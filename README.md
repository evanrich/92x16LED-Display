#92x16LED-Display

Custom made scrolling LED sign 92 dots wide by 16 tall.


This is going to be the repository for my latest project, a 96x16 LED sign.  

The sign consists of the following:
4x Sure 3216 LED Matrix Displays
1x Custom controller board with bluetooth capabilities to communicate with the Sign
1x Custom power board to deliver 6A to the sign from a 12V source (my car)
Custom cut Acrylic plastic along with various screws to mount and display the sign.

**If you want to see how-to instructions on how to assemble this, please look in the Wiki for a complete guide on how to build this sign**
