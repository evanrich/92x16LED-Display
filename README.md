92x16LED-Display
================

Custom made scrolling LED sign 92 dots wide by 16 tall.


This is going to be the repository for my latest project, a 96x16 LED sign.  

The sign consists of the following:
4x Sure 3216 LED Matrix Displays
1x Custom controller board with bluetooth capabilities to communicate with the Sign
1x Custom power board to deliver 6A to the sign from a 12V source (my car)
Custom cut Acrylic plastic along with various screws to mount and display the sign.

I'm roughly 45-60% done making this, The SURE 3216 panels are mounted to the acrylic, and the power board has been tested so far, I just need to complete the controller boards (arduino prototype works well), and post everything to github.  Please watch this if you are interested in the project and are thinking of doing something like this yourself.
